# Focusing on what matters in mobile UX

## Context and Background

* Mobile is a harsher environment
* Details matter
* Flaws are more readily noticed
* Task oriented
* Speed oriented
* Getting something done

## Task-oriented design

* Why are users here, what do they want to do?
* Example of Flight Check-in (show wireframes)
* Minimum Information (what's the least we need them to click or type? Typing sucks)
* Example of news site (Smashing Mag is a good example :-) )
* "Get out of my way" design

## Excel in the worst case

* Handling errors well sets you apart
* Refresh page (after the browser was slept?)
* Network connectivity - easy retry

## Speed

* Background as much as you can
* Postpone as much as you can
* Assume success, show changes locally, roll back on error
* Always show feedback on every action
* Preload the next page
* Cache previous pages ("I was just there! Why is it loading?")
* Keep the page light
* Load content first
