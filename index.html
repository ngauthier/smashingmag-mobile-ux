    <h1>Focusing On What Matters In Mobile UX</h1>
  </header>

  <p>The mobile web is a harsh environment. Mobile processors are slower than their desktop counterparts. Network connectivity is flaky, bandwidth is low, latency is high, and touchscreen keyboards are slow. The best mobile web applications are the ones that excel at handling these challenges. First, we're going to look at how to design a better mobile application by focusing on the tasks your users are trying to accomplish. Next, we'll improve their experience by remembering as much about them as possible so they don't have to repeat themselves. Finally, we'll focus on making their experience as fast as possible so they can get on with their lives.</p>

  <h2>Task-Oriented Design</h2>

  <p>First things first: why are your users here?</p>

  <p>Desktop users keep lots of pages open for long periods of time. Applications like Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, etc., are always open. On the desktop, we like to have everything at our fingertips. On mobile, many of these are replaced with native apps with push notifications. A user turns to mobile web when they want to accomplish something. They may have clicked a link in their Twitter client, and they want to read the article a friend posted. Maybe they're checking in to a flight, or checking restaurant hours, or looking up a bus schedule. They have a task that they're trying to accomplish, and when they're done their phone is going back in their pocket.</p>

  <p>Let's say you're in charge of Mobile Air's mobile experience. On the desktop, Mobile Air's home page is all about sales. Fare discount advertisements, enticing destinations, and a trip planner are at the forefront. Off in the corner are options for checking in to flights or flight status or rewards program information. This makes sense, because if someone is on a desktop computer they are most likely sitting down at home or at work planning a trip. But what about someone on a phone?</p>

  <p><strong>Mock-up of desktop with sales at the forefront and check-in and status on the side. Mock-up of mobile with status and checkin at the top, and reservations below.</strong></p>
  <p>If you're at home or at work and you want to visit Mobile Air, you're not going to take your phone out of your pocket to do it if a perfectly good laptop is sitting on the coffee table. Visitors to Mobile Air's mobile site are away from home. Odds are, they're traveling right now. The most prominent and accessible tasks should be flight status and check-in. Reservations should be possible but they aren't as high a priority. Already, we've flipped the entire experience on its head because we know more about why our users are here.</p>

  <h2>Memory</h2>

  <p><strong>Users has visited and checked in. What do we know about them? We know they have a flight coming up. We know who they are and probably have more flight info in our system (at least the return trip). Let's change their home page. If we know about an upcoming flight, show that flight's info.</strong></p>

  <p>Now that our users have visited the site and checked-in to a flight, we know more about them. We know who they are and we know where and when they are flying. We may know even more about them, like their return flight. If they are a frequent customer and have an account, we may know about other flights they've reserved. We can now customize the interface with this new information.</p>

  <p><strong>Updated version of this mockup. Show upcoming flight, return flight, then a future unrelated flight with a check in button.</strong></p>

  </div>

  <p>So, how should we store this data? We could store it on the server in a database, and then use a cookie on the client. That's the usual way to store this kind of thing. However, this is really a mobile-only interface and it's going to be short lived; once the user has completed their flights they don't need this interface any more. Additionally, storing the data on the server means that it's not available if wifi is lost (like when you're in-flight and your phone is in airplane mode). Here's an implementation of a flight-information cache using HTML5 LocalStorage:</p>

  <p><strong>Code example of storing flight info in local storage. Fetch on the server if possible.</strong></p>

  <p>This will store flight information on the phone, but we still would not be able to open the application if we don't have wifi. That's what HTML5 Application Cache Manifests are for. A cache manifest will tell the phone what files it can download and use offline. When the phone has internet, it will update these files. Here's a simple cache for our application:</p>

  <p><strong>HTML5 cache manifest for a one-html app, js, css, and images.</strong></p>


  <h3>Routing</h3>
  <p>At this point we have a fast application that can work offline, but we haven't tackled how it behaves when refreshed or when the browser is quit and re-opened. Imagine you're checking your flight status, and you're refreshing constantly. We could provide a button to do this, but what if you sleep your phone and pull it out of your pocket and wake it? Browsers will destroy a page's state after a while (or after switching apps) so your application needs to resume. That's where routes come in.</p>

  <p>Any page that stands alone should have its own route, and it should be able to be loaded purely by opening that route. Meaning that we must be able to reconstruct our application state without having to start at the main page and then navigate back to where we were. To do this, we will need a router. You could build one yourself, but there are many great JavaScript routers available in different frameworks. Here's a router in Backbone.js:</p>

  <p><strong>Show Backbone router that just has commented route action (e.g. "show flight here")</strong></p>

  <p>Combine a router with a LocalStorage-backed cache system, and you have an application that can resume <i>very</i> quickly, even without wifi access.</p>

  <h2>Perceived Speed</h2>

  <p>The hard truth of the mobile world is that it's incredibly difficult to deliver content at desktop speeds. Most mobile data providers see ping times on the order of hundreds of milliseconds. That means that assuming it takes 0ms for your application to process a request and 0ms for the phone to handle it and render it (yeah right!) you're still going to have a 300-500ms delay because of the time it takes the signal to travel across the network. The only option left is to cheat.</p>

  <p>Instagram is praised for its user experience, and one of their core tactics is to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mikeyk/secrets-to-lightning-fast-mobile-design">perform actions optimisitically</a>. That means, when a user says "post this status update" the system immediately says "done!" and moves the user back to their timeline, adding the new photo. Never mind that the data hasn't even left the phone yet. In reality, your photo was on Instagram's servers before you hit OK, and it was on your timeline before the server confirmed it. A double whammy of perceived speed!.</p>

  <p>Let's apply this concept to our mobile reservation system. We're going to have five pages: entering airports and dates, pick the first leg, pick the second leg, payment, and confirmation.</p>

  <p><strong>mock-up of these five screens</strong></p>
  
  <p>When a user has picked airports and dates, but <i>before</i> they have hit the "Find Flights" button, we will fetch the first leg info. This means that if they change those values a few times it could incur an extra data cost, but it also means that the next page will appear almost immediately. Here's how we can simply pre-fetch a page:</p>

  <p><strong>show how to fetch via ajax and keep the deferred object so that if it's fetched again it waits for the original. jQuery + JavaScript code.</strong></p>

  <p>In our design, the first and second leg selection are different screens, but that doesn't mean they have to be separate requests. We'll lump it into one request to get both the first and second date. That way the transition is instant. Entering payment requires no fetching, so that is easy. When the payment is POSTed to the server, we will do it synchronously with a loading screen. We don't want to assume success at this step. Plus, an uncannily quick response could actually make our users uneasy! Here's what our request chain looks like with and without pre-fetching data:</p>

  <p><strong>Change this mock-up to be for flight reservations. 1) fetch flights when airports or date changes, so when they hit "View Flights" it has already been retrieved. 2) combine first and second leg fetches. 3) When you enter payment and hit reserve, do it synchronously because this should not be done without permission.</strong></p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="img/sequence.jpeg" style="width: 796px; height: auto;">
  </div>

  <p>As you can see, we've parallelized the application with the user's actions. The user can be doing what they need to do (picking dates, picking flights) at the same time the application can predictively load the next page's information. This takes a lot of waiting out of the equation.</p>

  <h2>Focus on what Matters</h2>

  <p>Mobile interaction is a different world, with different constrains and different expectations. Simply adding a responsive stylesheet is not going to address your user's changing demands based on the context of their use. Keep the following steps in mind when you're building a mobile web application:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Identify</strong> the tasks your users want to accomplish on a mobile device</li>
    <li><strong>Memorize</strong> as much as you can about your users' situation</li>
    <li><strong>Presume</strong> that your users' actions will succeed, and get them to their next task</li>
    <li><strong>Predict</strong> your users' next actions and prepare accordingly</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The mobile web is a harsh environment, but you will find that these new constraints provide a clear path to a superior experience, simply by focusing on what matters.</p>
